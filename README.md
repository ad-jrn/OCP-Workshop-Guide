# OCP Workshop Guide

## Overview
Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) is a cloud-based Kubernetes platform for developing and running containerized applications. It is designed for ease-of-use and flexibility for both developers and end-users. OCP enables organizations to build, deploy, and scale applications quickly both on-premises and in the cloud. All while protecting your infrastructure with enterprise-grade security. This produces a more simple access point to underlying infrastructure that can help manage application life cycle and development workflows.

Welcome to day three of our workshop. Today we will be highlighting five features of OCP:
- Deploying a service
- Self-Healing
- Horizontal Pod Auto Scaling
- How to access the monitoring dashboard
- How to access log files

We will be using your environment that was prepared on [Day 2.](https://github.com/jmhossain/gitops-workshop-guide/blob/main/mq/README.md)

## Service Deployment from an Image

1. Navigate to your assigned IBM Cloud Environment. This will be listed in your TechZone invitation under Cluster URL. Afterwards, open the OpenShift Web Console in the upper righthand side of your Cluster.

2. From the OCP Web Console, switch from Administrator to Developer view in the left dropdown menu.

3. Afterwards, click on +Add and select `Container images`.

4. We will be deploying from a preloaded image from your environment's internal registry. From the dropdowns labeled Project/Image Stream:Tag, select `tools/aaa:latest`

![Deploy Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182545551-3121b732-828e-4834-af37-b5b2c85d86fb.png)

5. Proceed with the default options and select `create`.

6. Switch back to Administrator view in the top left and select Deployments underneath Workloads. From here we can confirm that it has been successfully deployed and is running. We'll return to this later for HorizontalPodAutoScaling.

## Self-Healing
Let's take a glance at some of our and see the tangible benefits of how OCP self heals.
1. Under `Workloads` select `Pods`. 

![Pods](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182551796-e0816b75-7164-4639-8bf8-267bab8c31c5.png)

2. Underneath the `Project:` dropdown menu, select `Tools`.

![Tools](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182552138-48aa7189-73b6-42ef-9d8b-0a72d1f9265f.png)

3. In the search bar, type in `nav`.

![Nav](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182552415-7cd54c46-2ac8-4c50-87b3-b6835ec3d001.png)

4. Select the Owner of one of these running Pods.

![Owner](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182552665-432b1e47-e506-47f5-9360-b1dce9f83a41.png)

5. Here we can view the ReplicaSet details that determine the current and desired states of our Pods.

![State](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182553049-6c331cc0-9922-4838-86bd-a6cc1f5a40e2.png)

6. Click on the `Pods` tab to view the running Pods.

![Pods](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182553267-e8bfe7d8-4bab-4a6f-a74c-1b7e1de9bace.png)

Here we will simulate what would happen if someone 'accidentally' deleted one of these pods.

7. Choose one of these pods and select `Delete Pod` from the three dot drop down menu.

![Oopsie](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182553829-364aa113-a24d-4a8b-93c2-98d15cb9c54c.png)

8. Select `Delete` and pay close attention to what happens.

![Oh no!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182554102-38e011a8-3366-4d40-83d2-8cc0adb35102.png)

Immediately you'll see that as that pod is terminated, a new one is created to replace it. You'll notice as well that the name of this new pod is different from the old one. This is because OpenShift is constantly monitoring and realizes that the current state (1 Pod) does not match the desired state (2 Pods).

![All good!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182555184-6bdb81ca-5e4c-4b1e-979d-12fd4effc5c4.png)

But just like that, everything is back to normal!

## Horizontal Pod Auto Scaling

1. Navigate back to the service we deployed earlier under `Workloads` and `Deployments`. Left click `aaa` to view it.

![aaa!](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182557224-61b459ab-caaf-40dc-8b4a-b7ae763b0ee3.png)

2. Viewing the deployment details, you'll see that there is only 1 Pod that is being autoscaled. Click on `Pods` to view the status of it.

![Status](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182557891-f86b1ebe-3df0-4fce-bdff-84118b69be02.png)

![CPU](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182558512-716b4424-f456-468e-ac28-ac9a77c618a0.png)

Looking at the CPU Usage, not much is going on right now where we would need this to be autoscaled up. Let's take a look at some of the settings.

3. In the left menu, select `HorizontalPodAutoscalers` and left click `HPA example`.

![HPA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182559452-e77bfc32-0ea2-42b3-9f66-75bf41f95463.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182559984-00c602ca-47fd-4d13-93fd-563511b88584.png)

Here you can view some of the user defined settings for the autoscaler. These can be editted in the YAML file. 

Now we'll simulate some traffic to test your autoscaler.

4. Return to your [Shell](https://cloud.ibm.com/shell) and re-enter your OC Login token.

5. Retrieve `aaa` URL.
```bash
oc get route -n tools aaa -o template --template='https://{{.spec.host}}'
```

6. Copy the output and send it to me!

## Monitoring Dashboard

1. In the `Administrator` perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to `Monitoring` → `Dashboards.`

2. Choose a dashboard in the Dashboard list. Some dashboards, such as etcd and Prometheus dashboards, produce additional sub-menus when selected.

3. Optional: Select a time range for the graphs in the Time Range list.

![Dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182624429-051ff392-3dd1-4b61-a3af-0156e3baeb19.png)


3a. Set a custom time range by selecting `Custom time range` in the `Time Range` list.

3b. Input or select the `From` and `To` dates and times.

3c. Click `Save` to save the custom time range.

4. Optional: Select a `Refresh Interval.`

5. Hover over each of the graphs within a dashboard to display detailed information about specific items.

## Access Log Files

1. In the `Administrator` perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to `Workloads` → `Pods`.

2. In the `Project:` dropdown at the top, select `tools`. Open the pod named `aaa`.

![PodLogs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182571500-af790e2c-ee90-430a-8d1a-e47f77ded9e1.png)


3. Select the `Logs` tab. Here, you may view the raw log file or download a copy.

![Logs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81570140/182571208-aa0516bf-2d9d-4d38-975d-1179a236daff.png)
